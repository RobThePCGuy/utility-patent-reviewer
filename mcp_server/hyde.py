"""
HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) Query Expansion for MPEP RAG

Implements multiple backends:
1. Rule-based patent law expansion (no external dependencies, always works)
2. Local small model (optional, lightweight)
3. External API (optional, best quality)

Philosophy: Works great offline, even better with optional enhancements.
