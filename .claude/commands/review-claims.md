# Claims Review

Analyze patent claims for definiteness, antecedent basis, and USPTO compliance.

## What I'll Check

1. **Format & Structure** - Proper claim organization and numbering
2. **Definiteness (35 USC 112(b))** - Clear, unambiguous claim language
3. **Antecedent Basis** - Correct use of "a/an" and "the"
4. **Claim Dependencies** - Proper reference structure
5. **Rejection Risks** - Potential indefiniteness issues

## Process

1. Ask for your patent claims
2. Search MPEP for relevant guidelines
3. Run automated analysis
4. Generate detailed report with:
   - Claim-by-claim findings
   - MPEP citations for each issue
   - Specific fix recommendations
   - Priority levels (Critical/Important/Minor)

## Output

You'll get a comprehensive report showing:
- ✓ What's compliant
- ⚠ What needs attention
- ✗ What must be fixed before filing

Each issue includes the MPEP section and how to fix it.
