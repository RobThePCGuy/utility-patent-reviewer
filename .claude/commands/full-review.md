# Complete Patent Application Review

Comprehensive USPTO compliance review of your complete application.

## What You'll Get

A complete analysis covering:
1. **Claims Analysis** - 35 USC 112(b) compliance
2. **Specification Review** - 35 USC 112(a) compliance
3. **Formalities Check** - MPEP 608 requirements
4. **Prior Art Search** (optional) - Similar patents
5. **Consolidated Report** - All findings in one place

## How It Works

I'll run three specialized reviews in parallel:
- `/review-claims` for your claims
- `/review-specification` for your spec
- `/review-formalities` for formalities

Then synthesize everything into one master report.

## What I Need

1. Your patent claims (all independent and dependent)
2. Your specification (or key sections)
3. Your abstract
4. Info about your drawings (if any)

You can provide these all at once or one at a time.

## Final Report Includes

- **Executive Summary** - Overall readiness assessment
- **Critical Issues** - Must fix before filing
- **Important Issues** - Strongly recommend fixing
- **Minor Improvements** - Consider addressing
- **MPEP References** - Citations for all findings
- **Action Items** - Prioritized to-do list
- **Filing Checklist** - Everything needed to file
- **Timeline Estimate** - How long to get filing-ready

## When to Use This

Use `/full-review` when:
- You have a complete draft application
- You want comprehensive feedback
- You're preparing to file soon

Use individual commands (`/review-claims`, etc.) when:
- You only want to check one section
- You're working on a specific part
- You want faster, focused feedback
