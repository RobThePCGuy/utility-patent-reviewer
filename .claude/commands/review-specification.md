# Specification Review

Check your specification for written description, enablement, and best mode requirements.

**Focus Area:** $ARGUMENTS

## What I'll Check

1. **Written Description (35 USC 112(a))** - Shows you possessed the invention
2. **Enablement (35 USC 112(a))** - Person skilled in the art can make and use it
3. **Best Mode (35 USC 112(a))** - Preferred embodiment disclosed
4. **Claim Support** - All claim elements are described

If you specified a focus area (written description, enablement, or best mode), I'll provide extra detail on that aspect.

## Process

1. Ask for your specification (or key sections)
2. Search MPEP for requirements
3. Analyze against 112(a) standards
4. Create claim support matrix
5. Generate report with:
   - Section-by-section analysis
   - MPEP citations
   - Missing disclosures
   - Recommendations

## Output

You'll get:
- Written description adequacy assessment
- Enablement scope analysis
- Claim support matrix
- Specific improvements needed
- MPEP references for all findings
