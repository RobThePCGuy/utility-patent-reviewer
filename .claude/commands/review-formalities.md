# Formalities Check

Verify all formal requirements for a complete patent application.

**Check Type:** $ARGUMENTS

## What I'll Check

1. **Abstract** - 150 words max, proper content (MPEP 608.01(b))
2. **Title** - 500 characters max, descriptive (MPEP 606)
3. **Drawings** - All claim features shown, proper numbering (MPEP 608.02)
4. **Required Sections** - Field, Background, Summary, etc.
5. **Filing Checklist** - Declaration, fees, IDS

If you specified a check type (abstract, title, drawings), I'll focus on that requirement. Otherwise, I'll check everything.

## Process

1. Ask for your application sections
2. Check each formality requirement
3. Search MPEP for standards
4. Generate compliance report with:
   - Checklist of all requirements
   - Non-compliance issues
   - How to fix each problem
   - Pre-filing checklist

## Output

You'll get:
- Section-by-section compliance status
- Specific issues with character/word counts
- Required vs optional items
- Filing preparation checklist
- Estimated fees based on claim count
